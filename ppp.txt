phone
programming


i offer a series of scripts and templates to help make your cell phone
use a bit more enjoyable, perhaps. not the use per se, but the stimuli
that alerts you to an incoming call or text.

rrr: Random-like Ring-tone Realization
ttt: Text Transmission Tones


sadly, phones offer no open audio programming interfaces that i am aware
of. i will admit to being well behind the curve [using an LG remarq
instead of a 'smart phone' (relying on user's "smarts" instead of
phone's, but i digress ...)], so they could exist; but i am not aware of
any. the reason i bring the issue up at all, is because the best use of
the programming would be to be run on the phone all the time. this way
each ring-tone [or text alert] would be unique, and yet, recognizable as
an audio indication that some agent is trying to contact you via your
device.

each script is an instance of something i might call
"encoded-randomness-generating-micro-variations" if i were still trying
to obtain a doctorate in music composition [done!], or start [or
further] a career for myself as a music theorist or critic [would
undoubtedly fail as i'm an awful self-promoter]. happily, none of that
is relevant, so i can call it "frank" if i want to.


in addition to the technical side of things, this music is also informed
by the many humanistic pursuits i undertake each day and over the course
of weeks, months, and years. probably foremost among them are my daoist
readings. red pine's excellent and scholarly translation of lau tzu's
classic is [still] on my bedside table. and i read them on twitter
too. merton's chuang tzu and many others have also deepened my
understanding.

the two scripts have many aspects that are representative of this
dualistic viewpoint:
- prime numbers vs. powers of two
- sine waves vs. noise
- "random" vs. deterministic data


i have once again been listening to a lot of sun ra's music; and
the freedom i allowed myself with the sounds i use in the scripts is
only one of the many learnings i receive from his music. 

i spent much time on the code itself; more thinking than writing, but
still a lot. on the one hand, i strive to make it as understandable as
possible, adding comments where i thought they were needed or would
help, and using white space to allow the reader to relax a bit. on the
other hand, all the elements contained within the code [variable names,
hard coded values, spacing to identify groups] were given careful
consideration in order to add to the overall effect.

also, i must acknowledge the open source software movement for making
these sounds possible. these are my tools:
- perl
- csound
- audacity
- vim
- linux


lastly, here is the output from a terminal session used to generate the
rrr sample file included with the package. look at all the csound
plugins that are not installed on my system!
